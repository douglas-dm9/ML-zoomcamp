Dataset: https://github.com/americanas-tech/b2w-reviews01

B2W-Reviews01 is an open corpus of product reviews in portuguese. It contains more than 130k e-commerce customer reviews, collected from the Americanas.com website between January and May, 2018. B2W-Reviews01 offers rich information about the reviewer profile, such as gender, age, and geographical location. The corpus also has two different review rates:

the usual 5-point scale rate, represented by stars in most e-commerce websites,
a "recommend to a friend" label, a "yes or no" question representing the willingness of the customer to recommend the product to someone else.

The ideia here is this project is to build a model to predict if a review has a positive, negative or neutral sentiment and deploy the model using BentoML and Docker to deploy on the AWS Cloud using.
